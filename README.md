# Hi, I'm Tobias

I'm a software architect, OSS contributor, and hands-on developer with a focus on infrastructure and DevOps automation.

I currently work as **Team Lead Software Development** at [WhereGroup](https://wheregroup.com/), a company specialized in **open-source GIS infrastructure**.

I'm the **lead architect** of [**MapComponents**](https://github.com/mapcomponents), a modular UI framework for building flexible and composable spatial web applications maintained by WhereGroup.

## What I Focus On

* **Open GIS Infrastructure** – OSS stacks for spatial data and mapping applications
* **MapComponents** – Creator and lead architect of a modular spatial UI framework
* **DevOps & CI/CD** – Container architecture design with Docker, Kubernetes, and modern CI systems (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, Azure Pipelines, etc.)
* **Process Standardization** – Versioning, build & deployment workflows across multiple teams
* **Creative Tools & OSS Projects** – Developer of CLI utilities, automation tools, and web-based creative tools
